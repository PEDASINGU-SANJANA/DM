This project applies data mining techniques and OLAP analysis to an AI tool usage survey dataset in order to:

--> Predict AI tool adoption trends.

--> Identify key factors influencing usage.

--> Provide actionable insights for AI tool development and adoption strategies.

The process integrates:

--> Data Preprocessing using Orange Data Mining Tool.

--> Data Warehousing with Star, Snowflake, and Fact Constellation schemas in SQL Server.

--> OLAP Operations for multi-dimensional analysis.

--> Classification Models to predict AI tool usage patterns
